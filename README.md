# Omakub for Fedora

Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub for Fedora. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub for Fedora is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best, specifically tailored for Fedora users.

This is a Fedora-specific fork of the original Omakub project, adapted to work with Fedora's dnf package manager and ecosystem.
